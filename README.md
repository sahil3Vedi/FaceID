Facial Recognition algorithm that differentiates the faces of 5 prominent world leaders using the face_recogntion.py library.
This library uses a set of pre_trained weights to determine facial encodings of a given image. The encodings can be compared among on another using either Euclidean distance or similarity measures to find the closest fit.
